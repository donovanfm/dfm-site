<p>
Simply put: we build websites.
</p>

<p>
But we like to think it's more just that. Here at DFM, we strive to build web experiences. There are plenty of ways to get a website nowadays, but chances are, you and your ideas are more than just a template, and similarly, your website should break the mold, too.
</p>

<p>
DFM uses the best technologies and best practices to give you a custom-fitted website that will meet your needs now and in the future: the "end" product we deliver you won't be an "end" product at all, as it will be flexible enough to develop and grow along with you and your needs.
